INPUT DESCRIPTION FOR THE IEC WIND GENERATING PROGRAM IECWind

  All 12 input lines should be present, although an error will only be generated
for incorrect parameters that are actually used in the program session.
  The first parameter is the condition for which the wind will be generated.  A
list of the conditions to be used in this line is given below in Table 1.  All
letters should be capitalized as they appear below.  The option ALL can also be
used to generate all conditions and all possible combinations.  For more details
on each condition see IEC standard 61400-1, 2nd edition.
  The second parameter specifies the units; SI or ENGLISH.  The units specified
should indicate those for the wind speed in lines 5 and 6, and the same will be
used for the output.
  The third parameter is the wind turbine class, 1, 2, 3, or 4, as specified by
the IEC standard.  This parameter is not used for condition ECG.
  The fourth parameter identifies the wind turbulence category (should be either
A or B).  This parameter is also not used for condition ECG.
  The fifth parameter is Vrated, which is the rated wind speed.
  The sixth parameter is Vout, or the cut-out wind speed.  Either Vrated or Vout
can be set to 0.0 (or less) and it will be ignored.  If both are used, two wind
files will be created - one for Vrated and one for Vout - for most cases.  The
exceptions are ECG and ECD for which Vout does not apply, and EWM for for which
neither is used.  (see the IEC 1400-1 standard for more details)
  The seventh parameter is the angle of the inflow to the rotor.  The IEC standard
(section 3.3) specifies a maximum inclination of 8 degrees with respect to the
horizontal.  This angle is assumed invariant with height.  IECWind will print a
warning to the screen for angles exceeding 8 degrees absolute value.
  The eighth parameter is the time in seconds for constant wind before the start of
the IEC condition.  This allows the turbine to stabilize before the start of the
transient condition.  This is not used for the steady EWM conditions.
  The ninth parameter is the time step used for the transient wind period in the
wind file.  The smaller the time step, the greater the number of points that will
be generated, and the smoother the curve.  Again, this is not used for the steady
EWM conditions.
  The tenth parameter is used to determine the sign on conditions which require
running both positive and negative cases to determine which case causes the
most severe loading. The conditions requiring this sign specifier are listed in
Table 1. Enter + for the positive cases and - for the negative cases or the word BOTH
to generate both positive and negative cases where applicable.  This parameter
is ignored for cases in which it does not apply, and when ALL cases are generated,
in which case both sign conditions are generated.
  The eleventh and twelfth parameters are the wind turbine hub-height and diameter,
respectively, used to determine the turbulence scale parameter and severity of gusts,
direction changes and shears.
